# A simple Neural Network, written in Numpy

## Why?
After finishing an exam i wanted to get back into python and spend a few days relearning and learning something new. After spending a few hours learning the `pytorch` framework, i wrote a simple sequential network with the MNIST dataset.

As my other plans where canceled by catching covid and not being able to stand up, i decided to test my understanding by writing the same type of network again, simply without a framework. In bed. On an IPad. 

I wanted to figure whatever i could about the design and function of the network myself, only looking up other solutions when i couldn't get it myself. This worked about 90% of the time. I struggled with getting the backwards propagation, especially the derivative of the softmax-function, right. In the end, to really understand, i had to do the calculation myself for my specific system. I will go deeper into this later on. In the end i got it to the point, at which including this part won't do any harm. We'll take it!
